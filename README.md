# AI-registration-pipeline
This repository will contain PyTorch + TensorFlow files using Python 3.6 to develop an AI registration pipeline for phase aberration correction in CT scans. Furthermore, an in-depth documentation for ML implementations are provided.

# Blood Spinal Cord Barrier
The blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is a physical barrier between the blood and spinal cord. The BSCB prevents toxins, blood cells, and pathogens from entering the spinal cord - all while maintaining a tightly controlled chemical balance in the spinal environment. However, through the application of focused ultrasound and its interaction with microbubbles can non-invasively open the BSCB for the therapeutic delivery of drugs.
